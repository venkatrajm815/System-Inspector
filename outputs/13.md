## Test 13: Mapping [1 pts]

Tests uid_to_uname function.

### Subtest 01: Comparing output against known username (root)
```
util.c:189:uid_to_uname(): Found it! The username is : root
> Assertion: name == 'root' [  OK  ]
> name: 'root'

--> Subtest passed
```

### Subtest 02: Mapping an unknown UID should yield the same UID in string form
```

> Assertion: fp != NULL [  OK  ]
Using UID: 3
> Assertion: name == '3' [  OK  ]
> name: '3'
Using UID: 4
> Assertion: name == '4' [  OK  ]
> name: '4'
Using UID: 5
> Assertion: name == '5' [  OK  ]
> name: '5'

--> Subtest passed
```

### Subtest 03: Comparing output against getpwuid(3). Also tests username length truncation.
